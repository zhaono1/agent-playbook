# Skill Router

An intelligent router that analyzes user requests and recommends the most appropriate Claude Code skill for the task.

## When This Skill Activates

This skill activates when you:
- Ask "which skill should I use?" or "what skill can help with...?"
- Say "use a skill" without specifying which one
- Express a need but aren't sure which skill fits
- Mention "skill router" or "help me find a skill"

## Routing Process

### Step 1: Intent Analysis

Analyze the user's request to identify:
- **Task Type**: What does the user want to accomplish?
- **Context**: What is the working domain (web, mobile, data, etc.)?
- **Complexity**: Is this a simple task or complex workflow?

### Step 2: Skill Matching

Match the identified intent to the most relevant skill(s) using:
- **Keyword matching**: Compare request keywords with skill descriptions
- **Semantic similarity**: Understand the meaning behind the request
- **Context awareness**: Consider project state and previous actions

### Step 3: Interactive Clarification

If the request is ambiguous, guide the user with targeted questions:
- What is the primary goal?
- What type of output is expected?
- Are there specific constraints or preferences?

### Step 4: Recommendation & Execution

Present the recommended skill with:
- Skill name and brief description
- Why it fits the current request
- Option to proceed or ask for alternatives

## Routing Examples

### Example 1: Clear Intent

**User:** "I need to review this pull request"

**Router Analysis:**
- Keywords: "review", "pull request"
- Intent: Code review
- **Recommendation:** `code-reviewer`

### Example 2: Ambiguous Intent

**User:** "Use a skill to help with my project"

**Router Questions:**
1. What type of task are you working on?
2. Are you designing, coding, testing, or documenting?

Based on answers → Recommend appropriate skill

### Example 3: Multi-Skill Scenario

**User:** "I'm building a new API and need help with the full workflow"

**Router Recommendation:**
Consider using multiple skills in sequence:
1. `api-designer` - Design the API structure
2. `api-documenter` - Document endpoints with OpenAPI
3. `test-automator` - Set up API tests
4. `code-reviewer` - Review implementation

## Interactive Question Templates

When user intent is unclear, use these question patterns:

### Goal Clarification
- "What are you trying to accomplish with this task?"
- "What would the ideal outcome look like?"

### Domain Identification
- "What area does this relate to: development, testing, documentation, or deployment?"
- "Are you working on code, APIs, infrastructure, or something else?"

### Stage Assessment
- "What stage are you at: planning, implementing, testing, or maintaining?"

### Preference Confirmation
- "Do you want a quick solution or a comprehensive approach?"
- "Are there specific tools or frameworks you're using?"

## Best Practices

### 1. Start Broad, Then Narrow
- Begin with general category questions
- Drill down into specifics based on responses

### 2. Explain Your Reasoning
- Tell the user why a particular skill is recommended
- Build trust through transparency

### 3. Offer Alternatives
- Present the top recommendation
- Mention 1-2 alternatives if applicable

### 4. Handle Edge Cases
- If no skill fits perfectly, suggest the closest match
- Offer to help without a specific skill if better

### 5. Learn from Context
- Consider previous interactions
- Remember user preferences for future routing

## Advanced Routing Patterns

### Semantic Routing
Use semantic similarity when keywords don't match directly:
- "clean up my code" → `refactoring-specialist`
- "make my app faster" → `performance-engineer`
- "check for security issues" → `security-auditor`
- "resume this interrupted workflow" → `long-task-coordinator`

### Multi-Skill Orchestrations
Suggest skill combinations for complex workflows:
- **New Feature**: `architecting-solutions` → `debugger` → `code-reviewer`
- **API Project**: `api-designer` → `api-documenter` → `test-automator`
- **Production Readiness**: `security-auditor` → `performance-engineer` → `deployment-engineer`

### Confidence Levels
Indicate confidence in recommendations:
- **High**: Direct keyword match, clear intent
- **Medium**: Semantic similarity, reasonable inference
- **Low**: Ambiguous request, clarification needed

## Error Recovery

If the recommended skill doesn't fit:
1. Acknowledge the mismatch
2. Ask follow-up questions to refine understanding
3. Provide alternative recommendations
4. Fall back to general assistance if needed

## Output Format

When recommending a skill, use this format:

```markdown
## Recommended Skill: {skill-name}

{brief description of why this skill fits}

**What it does:** {one-sentence skill description}

**Best for:** {specific use cases}
